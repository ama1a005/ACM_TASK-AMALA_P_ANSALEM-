# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Implementation Comparison

## Overview
This document compares two different implementations of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm:

1. **Scikit-learn KNN Implementation**: Utilizes the `sklearn` library for KNN, which is highly optimized and easy to use.
2. **Custom KNN Implementation**: A KNN model built from scratch to understand the underlying mechanics of the algorithm.

## Comparison of Results

- **Accuracy/Performance**:  
  Both implementations yield the same accuracy, as KNN is a straightforward algorithm. They perform similarly for small datasets.

- **Training Time**:  
  Scikit-learn is generally faster due to its use of optimized libraries such as NumPy and pre-built structures.

- **Code Complexity**:  
  Scikit-learn abstracts away much of the complexity, making the implementation simpler, more concise, and less prone to errors.

- **Scalability**:  
  Scikit-learn scales better with larger datasets due to optimizations like KD-Trees or Ball Trees.

## Conclusion

**Scikit-learn's KNN** is more practical for real-world scenarios, especially when dealing with large datasets, due to its optimizations and ease of use.

**Custom KNN implementation** is an excellent learning exercise to understand how the KNN algorithm works at a fundamental level, making it ideal for educational purposes or when a deep understanding of the algorithm is required.
