# Iris Dataset Clustering Analysis

## Overview
This project involves clustering the Iris dataset to analyze the patterns and groupings of different flower species. The Iris dataset is a popular dataset used for pattern recognition and machine learning tasks, and it includes measurements for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of iris flowers.

## Cluster Summary

- **Cluster 0 (Green)**: Represents a tightly grouped cluster, likely corresponding to one of the iris flower species. This grouping suggests a distinct set of measurements unique to a particular flower type.
  
- **Cluster 1 (Purple)**: Forms an elongated shape, indicating a continuous variation or trend within the data. This cluster may represent a species with more variability in its measurements.
  
- **Cluster 2 (Yellow)**: Another elongated cluster, but oriented in a different direction. This cluster also indicates a unique group or pattern within the dataset.

## Conclusion
The three clusters formed are most likely to correspond to the three different flower species in the Iris dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of the clustering model in separating distinct patterns.
